                    <h5 class="card-title">Why was my order or an object in my order canceled?</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">The main reason why an object could be canceled are when the objects are too fragile to be printed without causing a risk to our 3D production, The object is cantilevered and if the object was printed it would not be to the customer's satisfaction.In the case of any cancellation, you should check your emails as an email is sent with a reason for the cancellation.</p>

                    <h5 class="card-title">How are prices calculated?</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">Pricing is based on a series of factors, including: volume of the object, the size, the amount of raw material used, the labor (mainly post printing) and multiple other factors. These are the major factors that can affect the price.The cost of your 3D print is automatically calculated the moment you upload your 3D file to our site. The calculations are interactive and will change as you modify your personalized object and 3D printing options (if no 3D file is provided, a precise price quote cannot be established).</p>
